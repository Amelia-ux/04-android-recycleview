## Coding Challenges
Challenge 1: Change the options menu to show only one option: Reset. This option should return the list of words to its original state, with nothing clicked and no extra words.

Challenge 2: Creating a click listener for each item in the list is easy, but it can hurt the performance of your app if you have a lot of data. Research how you could implement this more efficiently. This is an advanced challenge. Start by thinking about it conceptually, and then search for an implementation example.

- As an option, add an image for the finished dish to each recipe.
